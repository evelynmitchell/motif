Motif elicits the preferences of a Large Language Model (LLM) on pairs of captioned observations from a dataset of interactions collected on NetHack. Automatically, it distills the LLM's common sense into a reward function that is used to train agents with reinforcement learning.

To facilitate comparisons, we provide training curves in the pickle file `motif_results.pkl`, containing a dictionary with tasks as keys. For each task, we provide a list of timesteps and average returns for Motif and baselines, for multiple seeds.

As illustrated in the following figure, Motif features three phases:
1. **Dataset annotation**: use an LLM's preferences on pairs of captioned observations to create an annotated dataset of pairs;
2. **Reward training**: train a reward function using the annotated dataset of pairs and the preferences from the LLM as supervision signal;
3. **Reinforcement learning training**: train an agent using Motif's reward function.

We detail each of the phases by providing the necessary datasets, commands and raw results to reproduce the experiments in the paper.

We evaluate Motif's performance on the challenging, open-ended and procedurally generated NetHack game through the [NetHack Learning Environment](https://github.com/facebookresearch/nle). We investigate how Motif mostly generates intuitive human-aligned behaviors, which can be steered easily through prompt modifications, as well as its scaling properties.

To install the required dependencies for the whole pipeline, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Dataset annotation with Llama 2
For the first phase, we use a dataset of pairs of observations with captions (i.e., messages from the game) collected by agents
trained with reinforcement learning to maximize the game score. 
We provide the dataset in this repository.
We store the different parts into the `motif_dataset_zipped` directory, that can be unzipped using the following command.

```
cat motif_dataset_zipped/motif_dataset_part_* > motif_dataset.zip; unzip motif_dataset.zip; rm motif_dataset.zip
```

The dataset we provide features a set of preferences given by Llama 2 models, contained in the `preference/` directory, using the different prompts described in the paper.
The names of the `.npy` files containing the annotations follow the template `llama{size}b_msg_{instruction}_{version}`, where `size` is an LLM size from the set `{7,13,70}`, `instruction` is an instruction introduced to the prompt given to the LLM from the set `{defaultgoal, zeroknowledge, combat, gold, stairs}`, `version` is the version of the prompt template to be used from the set `{default, reworded}`.
Here we provide a summary of the available annotations:

| Annotation | Use case from the paper |
| -------- | -------- |
| `llama70b_msg_defaultgoal_default` | Main experiments |
| `llama70b_msg_combat_default` |  Steering towards _The Monster Slayer_ behavior |
| `llama70b_msg_gold_default` | Steering towards _The Gold Collector_ behavior |
| `llama70b_msg_stairs_default` | Steering towards _The Descender_ behavior |
| `llama7b_msg_defaultgoal_default` | Scaling experiment |
| `llama13b_msg_defaultgoal_default` | Scaling experiment |
| `llama70b_msg_zeroknowledge_default` |  Zero-knowledge prompt experiment |
| `llama70b_msg_defaultgoal_reworded` | Prompt rewording experiment |

To create the annotations, we use [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and the chat version of [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/). if you want to generate your own annotations with Llama 2 or reproduce our annotation process, make sure to be able to download the model by following the [official instructions](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) (it can take a few days to have access to the model weights).

The annotation script assumes the dataset will be annotated in different chunks using the `n-annotation-chunks` argument. This allows for a process that can be parallelized depending on the availability of resources, and is robust to restarts/preemption. To run with a single chunk (i.e., to process the entire dataset), and annotate with the default prompt template and task specification, run the following command.

```
python -m scripts.annotate_pairs_dataset --directory motif_dataset \
                                 --prompt-version default --goal-key defaultgoal \
                                 --n-annotation-chunks 1 --chunk-number 0 \
                                 --llm-size 70 --num-gpus 8
```

Note that the default behavior resumes the annotation process by appending the annotations to the file specifying the configuration, unless otherwise indicated with the `--ignore-existing` flag. The name of the '.npy' file that is created for the annotations can also be manually selected by using the `--custom-annotator-string` flag. It is possible to annotate using `--llm-size 7` and `--llm-size 13` using a single GPU with 32GB of memory.
You can annotate using `--llm-size 70` with an 8-GPUs node. We provide here rough estimates of annotation times with NVIDIA V100s 32G GPUs, for a dataset of 100k pairs, which should be able to roughly reproduce most of our results (which are obtained with 500k pairs).

| Model | Resources to annotate |
| -------- | -------- |
| Llama 2 7b | ~32 GPU hours |
| Llama 2 13b | ~40 GPU hours |
| Llama 2 70b | ~72 GPU hours |

## Reward training
In the second phase, we distill the LLM's preferences into a reward function through cross-entropy. To launch the reward training with default hyperparameters, use the following command.

```
python -m scripts.train_reward  --batch_size 1024 --num_workers 40  \
        --reward_lr 1e-5 --num_epochs 10 --seed 777 \
        --dataset_dir motif_dataset --annotator llama70b_msg_defaultgoal_default \
        --experiment standard_reward --train_dir train_dir/reward_saving_dir
```

The reward function will be trained through the annotations of the `annotator` that are located in `--dataset_dir`. The resulting function will then be saved in `train_dir` under the sub-folder `--experiment`.

## RL training
Finally, we train an agent with the resulting reward functions through reinforcement learning. To train an agent on the `NetHackScore-v1` task, with the default hyperparameters employed for experiments combining intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, you can use the following command.

```
python -m scripts.main --algo APPO --env nle_fixed_eat_action --num_workers 24 \
        --num_envs_per_worker 20 --batch_size 4096 --reward_scale 0.1 --obs_scale 255.0 \
        --train_for_env_steps 2_000_000_000 --save_every_steps 10_000_000 \       
        --keep_checkpoints 5 --stats_avg 1000 --seed 777  --reward_dir train_dir/reward_saving_dir/standard_reward/ \
        --experiment standard_motif --train_dir train_dir/rl_saving_dir \
        --extrinsic_reward 0.1 --llm_reward 0.1 --reward_encoder nle_torchbeast_encoder \
        --root_env NetHackScore-v1 --beta_count_exponent 3 --eps_threshold_quantile 0.5
```

To change the task, simply modify the `--root_env` argument. The following table explicitly states the values required in order to match experiments presented to in the paper. The `NetHackScore-v1` task is learned with the `extrinsic_reward` value to be `0.1`, while all other tasks take a value of `10.0`, in order to incentivize the agent to reach the goal.

| Environment | `root_env` |
| -------- | -------- |
| score | `NetHackScore-v1` |
| staircase | `NetHackStaircase-v1` |
| staircase (level 3) | `NetHackStaircaseLvl3-v1` |
| staircase (level 4) | `NetHackStaircaseLvl4-v1` |
| oracle | `NetHackOracle-v1` |
| oracle-sober | `NetHackOracleSober-v1` |

Additionally, if you want to train agents just using the intrinsic reward coming from the LLM but no reward from the environment, simply set `--extrinsic_reward 0.0`. In the intrinsic reward-only experiments, we terminate the episode only if the agent dies, rather than when the agent reaches the goal. These modified environments are enumerated in the following table.

| Environment | `root_env` |
| -------- | -------- |
| staircase (level 3) - intrinsic only | `NetHackStaircaseLvl3Continual-v1` |
| staircase (level 4) - intrinsic only| `NetHackStaircaseLvl4Continual-v1` |

## Visualize your RL agent
We additionally provide a script for visualizing your trained RL agents. This can provide important insights into its behaviour, but also will generated the top messages for each episode, which can help understanding what it is trying to optimize for. You simply need to run the following command.
```
python -m scripts.visualize --train_dir train_dir/rl_saving_dir --experiment standard_motif
```
